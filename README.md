# Regression-Model-Coursera--Motor-Trend
In this project we explore the relationship between miles per gallon (MPG) and a set of variables from the Motor Trends car dataset. We are particularly interested in the following two questions:  Is an automatic or manual transmission better for MPG? How can we quantify the difference in MPG between manual and automatic transmissions?
